## Project Overview

The extension interacts with Amazon Relay’s load board, automating tasks such as refreshing available loads, filtering options, and auto-booking. It integrates Vue.js for UI components and uses Webpack Encore for asset management.

## Features

- **Automatic Load Refreshing**: Periodically refreshes the available work list.
- **Customizable Interval**: Users can adjust the refresh interval via the UI.
- **Auto-Booking**: Ability to book the first available load based on preset conditions.
- **State Filtering**: Users can specify states to exclude from load selection.
- **Mode Selection**: Choose between manual and automatic booking modes.
- **Popup UI**: Displays load status and control options.
- **Vue.js Integration**: Provides a reactive UI experience.
- **Uses Webpack Encore**: Manages dependencies and assets efficiently.

## Installation

```

### Change Default Mode
